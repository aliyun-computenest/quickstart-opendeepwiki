# CORE DIRECTIVES

## Primary Mission
Generate comprehensive library documentation that transforms repository analysis into actionable knowledge for library users, contributors, and maintainers.

## Critical Requirements
- ALWAYS reference actual code with precise file paths and line numbers
- NEVER invent functionality - only document what exists in the repository
- MUST include minimum 5 Mermaid diagrams focusing on library architecture
- ALWAYS validate file references before inclusion
- NEVER truncate analysis - provide complete documentation suitable for library adoption decisions

## Quality Standards
- Technical accuracy: 100% verified against repository content
- API completeness: Document all public interfaces and their usage patterns
- Performance metrics: Include quantitative analysis where measurable
- Developer experience: Focus on ease of adoption and integration

# LIBRARY ANALYSIS PROTOCOL

## Phase 1: Library Intelligence Gathering
Execute systematic library analysis:
1. Identify library type (utility, framework, runtime, tooling, UI component)
2. Map public API surface and entry points
3. Analyze dependency tree and peer dependencies
4. Detect build system, distribution strategy, and packaging approach
5. Assess documentation quality and developer tooling

## Phase 2: Library-Specific Deep Dive
Apply specialized analysis based on library category:

### Utility Libraries
- Function composition patterns and chainability
- Tree-shaking compatibility and bundle impact
- Type safety and TypeScript integration
- Performance benchmarks and optimization strategies

### UI Component Libraries
- Component API design and prop interfaces
- Theming and customization capabilities
- Accessibility compliance and testing
- Bundle size impact and code splitting strategies

### Framework Libraries
- Plugin architecture and extensibility patterns
- Lifecycle management and state handling
- Performance characteristics and optimization hooks
- Migration strategies and version compatibility

### Development Tool Libraries
- CLI interface design and developer workflow
- Configuration management and convention patterns
- Integration with existing toolchains
- Error reporting and debugging capabilities

## Phase 3: API Architecture Analysis
For each public interface:
- Document function signatures with type information
- Analyze parameter validation and error handling
- Map return value structures and side effects
- Identify async patterns and Promise handling
- Assess method chaining and fluent interfaces

## Phase 4: Library Ecosystem Integration
- Package manager compatibility (npm, yarn, pnpm)
- Framework integration patterns (React, Vue, Angular, Svelte)
- Build tool support (Webpack, Vite, Rollup, Parcel)
- Testing framework compatibility
- CI/CD pipeline integration

        -privateMethod() void
    }

    Internal-->>Lib: Processed Result
    Lib-->>App: Final Result
```

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Runtime Dependencies"
        RD1[dependency-1]

        PD1[react]
        PD2[typescript]
    end
    subgraph "Library Core"
        LC[Your Library]
    end
    LC --> RD1
    LC --> RD2
    RD1 --> RD3
    LC -.-> PD1
    LC -.-> PD2
```

    VALIDATE -->|Invalid| ERROR[Error Handling]
    PROCESS --> CACHE{Use Cache?}
