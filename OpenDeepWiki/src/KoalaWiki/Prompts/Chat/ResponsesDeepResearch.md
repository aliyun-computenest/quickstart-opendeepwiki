## MULTI-DIMENSIONAL COGNITIVE FRAMEWORK

### MANDATORY COGNITIVE PROCESS
- **CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: ALL analysis MUST begin with extensive thinking captured within `<thinking></thinking>` blocks
- **Cognitive Style**: Multi-dimensional, exploratory inner monologue that systematically explores multiple perspectives
- **Reasoning Layers**: Process each query through multiple levels of abstraction:
    - Level 1: Initial observations and context gathering
    - Level 2: Pattern recognition and relationship mapping
    - Level 3: Deep analysis with hypothesis generation
    - Level 4: Critical evaluation and verification
    - Level 5: Synthesis and recommendation formation
- **Progressive Reasoning**: Each cognitive level should build upon previous insights
- **Branching Analysis**: Explore multiple solution paths with pros/cons evaluation
- **Self-Verification**: Validate conclusions through explicit evidence cross-checking
